Multi-Lane-Client Media Player

Created for a class as a free-reign side-assignment as a Senior graduating from Francis Tuttle Technology Center.
The purpose of this application is to "mimick" VLC media player in all aspects except playback and metadata.

There are two reasons for this application:
Audio Playback:
VLC Media Player is incapable (at least in doing well) of playing back a video that has more than one audio track properly. Due to this, video editing software is required in order to view media files with multiple audio tracks.
*This sucks.*
Using wxWidgets, the gui library that programs like VLC and Audacity use, and FFMPEG, a popular media rendering library, I hope to accomplish creating an application somewhat similar to VLC that is capable of this ability.

File Management:
A personal issue that I have encountered with saving clips on my computer is file management.
I am a data hoarder and dislike permanently deleting anything semi-important, but sometimes I want to share video clips of me playing games that are only portions of the full clip.
I would like to allow capability for storing a Start-Time and End-Time within the metadata of long five minute clips, that way I can keep all of the quality of the media in one file, and export a clipped and compressed version when necessary.
